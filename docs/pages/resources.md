- ['My Jekyll Fork', by Mike West](https://mikewest.org/2009/11/my-jekyll-fork)

  > "Jekyll is a well-architected throwback to a time before WordPress, when men were men, and HTML was static. I like the ideas it espouses, and have made a few improvements to it's core. Here, I'll point out some highlights of my fork in the hopes that they see usage beyond this site."

- ['About this Website', by Carter Allen](http://cartera.me/2010/08/12/about-this-website/)

  > "Jekyll is everything that I ever wanted in a blogging engine. Really. It isn't perfect, but what's excellent about it is that if there's something wrong, I know exactly how it works and how to fix it. It runs on the your machine only, and is essentially an added"build" step between you and the browser. I coded this entire site in TextMate using standard HTML5 and CSS3, and then at the end I added just a few little variables to the markup. Presto-chango, my site is built and I am at peace with the world."
