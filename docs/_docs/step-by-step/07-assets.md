Using CSS, JS, images and other assets is straightforward with Jekyll. Place
them in your root folder and they’ll copy across to the built site.

Jekyll sites often use this structure to keep assets organized:

```
.
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   ├── images
│   └── js
...
```
So, from your assets folder, create folders called css, images and js.
Additionally, directly under the root create another folder called `_sass`, which you will need shortly.

## Sass

Inlining the styles used in `_includes/navigation.html`(adding or configuring within the same file) is not a best practice.
Instead, let's style the current page by defining our first class in a new css file instead. 

To do this, refer to the class (that you will configure in the next parts of this step) from within the `navigation.html` file by removing the code you added earlier (to color the current link red) and inserting the following code:

{% raw %}
```liquid
<nav>
  {% for item in site.data.navigation %}
    <a href="{{ item.link }}"{% if page.url == item.link %} class="current"{% endif %}>{{ item.name }}</a>
  {% endfor %}
</nav>
```
{% endraw %}

You could use a standard CSS file for styling, we're going to take it a step
further by using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Sass is a fantastic extension
to CSS baked right into Jekyll.

First create a Sass file at `assets/css/styles.scss` with the following content:

```sass
---
---
@import "main";
```

The empty front matter at the top tells Jekyll it needs to process the file. The
`@import "main"` tells Sass to look for a file called `main.scss` in the sass
directory (`_sass/` by default) you already created at the root of your working directory earlier.

At this stage you'll just have a main css file. For larger projects, this is a
great way to keep your CSS organized.

Create the current class mentioned above in order to color the current link green. Create a Sass file at `_sass/main.scss` with the following content:

```sass
.current {
  color: green;
}
```

You'll need to reference the stylesheet in your layout.

Open `_layouts/default.html` and add the stylesheet to the `<head>`:

{% raw %}
```liquid
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    {% include navigation.html %}
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
```
{% endraw %}

The `styles.css` referenced here is generated by Jekyll from the `styles.scss` you created earlier in `assets/css/`.

Load up <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>http://localhost:4000</a>
and check that the active link in the navigation is green.

Next we're looking at one of Jekyll's most popular features, blogging.
