Sites built using Jekyll can be deployed in a large number of ways due to the static nature of the generated output. Here's some of the most common ways:

* [Manually]({{ '/docs/deployment/manual/' | relative_url }})
* [Automated]({{ '/docs/deployment/automated/' | relative_url }})
* [Third Party]({{ '/docs/deployment/third-party/' | relative_url }})
* [Multiple Sites and Target]({{ '/docs/deployment/multiple-sites' | relative_url }})
