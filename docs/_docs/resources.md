Jekyll's growing use is producing a wide variety of tutorials, frameworks, extensions, examples, and other resources that can be very helpful. Below is a collection of links to some of the most popular Jekyll resources.

## Editors

- [jekyll-atom](https://atom.io/packages/jekyll): A collection of snippets and tools for Jekyll in Atom
- [markdown-writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer): An Atom package for Jekyll. It can create new posts/drafts, manage tags/categories, insert link/images and add many useful key mappings.
- [sublime-jekyll](https://github.com/23maverick23/sublime-jekyll): A Sublime Text package for Jekyll static sites. This package should help creating Jekyll sites and posts easier by providing access to key template tags and filters, as well as common completions and a current date/datetime command (for dating posts). You can install this package manually via GitHub, or via [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Jekyll).
- [vim-jekyll](https://github.com/parkr/vim-jekyll): A vim plugin to generate new posts and run `jekyll build` all without leaving vim.
- [WordPress2Jekyll](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp2jekyll/): A WordPress plugin that allows you to use WordPress as your editor and (automatically) export content in to Jekyll. WordPress2Jekyll attempts to marry these two systems together in order to make a site that can be easily managed from all devices.

- ['My Jekyll Fork', by Mike West](https://mikewest.org/2009/11/my-jekyll-fork)

  > "Jekyll is a well-architected throwback to a time before WordPress, when men were men, and HTML was static. I like the ideas it espouses, and have made a few improvements to it's core. Here, I'll point out some highlights of my fork in the hopes that they see usage beyond this site."

- ['About this Website', by Carter Allen](http://cartera.me/2010/08/12/about-this-website/)

  > "Jekyll is everything that I ever wanted in a blogging engine. Really. It isn't perfect, but what's excellent about it is that if there's something wrong, I know exactly how it works and how to fix it. It runs on the your machine only, and is essentially an added"build" step between you and the browser. I coded this entire site in TextMate using standard HTML5 and CSS3, and then at the end I added just a few little variables to the markup. Presto-chango, my site is built and I am at peace with the world."
