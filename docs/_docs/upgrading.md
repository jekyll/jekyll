Upgrading from an older version of Jekyll? Upgrading to a new major version of Jekyll (e.g. from v2.x to v3.x) may cause some headaches. Take the following guides to aid your upgrade:

- [From 0.x to 1.x and 2.x](/docs/upgrading/0-to-2/)
- [From 2.x to 3.x](/docs/upgrading/2-to-3/)

If you are making a minor update (for example from 3.3.1  to 3.3.2 ) run 'gem update jekyll' when in your site directory.
