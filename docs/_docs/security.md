## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities by sending an email to security@jekyllrb.com with the following information:

1. A description of the vulnerability
2. Reproduction steps and/or a sample site (share a private repo to the [Jekyll Security Team](/team/))
3. Your contact information

The Jekyll security team will respond to your submission and notify you whether it has been confirmed by the team.
Your confidentiality is kindly requested as we work on a fix. We will provide our patch to you to test and verify that the vulnerability has
been closed.

If you have created a patch and would like to submit that to us as well, we will happily consider it though we cannot guarantee that we will
use it. If we use your patch, we will attribute authorship to you either as the commit author, or as a co-author.

Once a fix is verified, we will release PATCH versions of the supported MINOR versions and assign a CVE to the vulnerability. You will receive
credit in our release post.

Once the patched version has been released, we will no longer request you to maintain confidentiality and you may choose to share details on
how you found the vulnerability with the community.
