Coming just 10 days after the release of v1.1.0, v1.1.1 is out with a patch for
the nasty excerpt inception bug ([#1339]({{ site.repository }}/issues/1339)) and
non-zero exit codes for invalid commands ([#1338]({{ site.repository
}}/issues/1338)).

To all those affected by the [strange excerpt bug in v1.1.0]({{ site.repository
}}/issues/1321), I'm sorry. I think we have it all patched up and it should be
deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) in the next couple weeks.
Thank you for your patience!
