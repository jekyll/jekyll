Just in time for the US holiday Thanksgiving, we're releasing version
1.3.1 of Jekyll to address some of the issues seen since the
release of 1.3.0.

In addition to a couple of other smaller bug fixes, the biggest thing
we've fixed is an issue with the `--watch` option with Ruby 1.8.7. For a
full run-down, visit our [change log](/docs/history/)!

Thanks to all the people who have contributed to this release! They are
(in alphabetical order): Abhi Yerra, Anatol Broder, Andreas Möller, Greg
Karékinian, Sam Rayner, Santeri Paavolainen, Shigeya Suzuki, Yihang Ho,
albertogg, andrewhavens, maul.esel, and thomasdao
