As work continues on Jekyll 2.0.0, we felt it was important to address two key
issues of Jekyll 1.4.3, namely the `safe_yaml` dependency below 1.0 and the
inability to use Jekyll 1.4.3 on Windows due to a [fun issue with path sanitizing][].

For a full changelog, check out our [history][] page.

Now, back to work on 2.0.0!
