Hey! After many months of hard work by Jekyll's contributors, we're excited
to announce the first major release of the project in a long while. v1.0.0 is
finally here! While the list of improvements and bug fixes is [quite lengthy][history],
here are the highlights (thanks to [@benbalter](https://twitter.com/BenBalter) for the
examples and for compiling this list):

- Support for the Gist tag for easily embedding Gists ([example](https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555251))
- Automatically generated post excerpts ([example](https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555369))
- Save and preview drafts before publishing ([example](https://gist.github.com/benbalter/5555992))

Take a look at the [Upgrading][] page in the docs for more detailed information.
