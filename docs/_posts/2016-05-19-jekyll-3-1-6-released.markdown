Upon releasing 3.1.5 and kicking the tires, we noticed a glaring bug: our
beloved `jsonify` filter doesn't work! With that, our work was cut out for
us and we decided a 3.1.6 was necessary. This release restores sanity to
our object-to-JSON generation in Liquid and we hope you enjoy.

For the gory details, see [the pull
request](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/pull/4914) or [the
changelog](/docs/history/#v3-1-6).

Happy Jekylling!
