This version fixes a bug affecting only v3.0.4 where autoregeneration was
*always* disabled when running Jekyll locally. This feature is a huge
reason why Jekyll (or any static site generator, for that matter) is a joy
to use. Sorry for the regression!

If you're using GitHub Pages, [you can follow the progress of the upgrade
on the github/pages-gem repo](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/pull/285).

As always, our [history doc](/docs/history/#v3-0-5) has links to the pull
requests and issues associated with the release for your perusal.

We're looking forward to the upcoming release of v3.2 which [has some
excellent goodies](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/History.markdown#head)
we think you'll love.

Happy Jekylling!
