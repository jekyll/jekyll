This is a high-level roadmap for Jekyll. It is a list of things we're
planning for each release. While plans are subject to change, this should
offer a bit of an overview for anyone interested in future features.

- [v3.2](#v3.2)
- [v3.3](#v3.3)

## v3.2

For v3.2, we're interested in shipping:

1. **Gem-based themes.** This will allow users to ship layouts, includes, and sass (to start with) in a way that is more easily consumable and versionable.
