Jekyll has a plugin system with hooks that allow you to create custom generated
content specific to your site. You can run custom code for your site
without having to modify the Jekyll source itself.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Plugins on GitHub Pages</h5>
  <p>GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, however all Pages sites are generated using the <code>--safe</code> option to disable custom plugins for security reasons. Unfortunately, this means your plugins won’t work if you’re deploying to GitHub Pages.</p>
</div>

## Installing a plugin

In your site source root, make a `_plugins` directory. Place your plugins
here. Any file ending in `*.rb` inside this directory will be required
when Jekyll generates your site.

In general, plugins you make will fall into one of three categories:

1. Generators
2. Converters
3. Tags

## Generators

You can create a generator when you need Jekyll to create additional
content based on your own rules. For example, a generator might look
like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
module Jekyll

  class CategoryPage < Page
    def initialize(site, base, dir, category)
      @site = site
      @base = base
      @dir = dir
      @name = 'index.html'

      self.process(@name)
      self.read_yaml(File.join(base, '_layouts'), 'category_index.html')
      self.data['category'] = category

      category_title_prefix = site.config['category_title_prefix'] || 'Category: '
      self.data['title'] = "#{category_title_prefix}#{category}"
    end
  end

  class CategoryPageGenerator < Generator
    safe true

    def generate(site)
      if site.layouts.key? 'category_index'
        dir = site.config['category_dir'] || 'categories'
        site.categories.keys.each do |category|
          site.pages << CategoryPage.new(site, site.source, File.join(dir, category), category)
        end
      end
    end
  end

end
{% endhighlight %}

In this example, our generator will create a series of files under the
`categories` directory for each category, listing the posts in each
category using the `category_index.html` layout.

Generators are only required to implement one method:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>generate</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>String output of the content being generated.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Converters

If you have a new markup language you’d like to include in your site,
you can include it by implementing your own converter. Both the markdown
and textile markup languages are implemented using this method.

<div class="note info">
  <h5>Remember your YAML front-matter</h5>
  <p>Jekyll will only convert files that have a YAML header at
the top, even for converters you add using a plugin. If there is no YAML header, Jekyll will ignore the file and not send it through the converter.</p>
</div>

Below is a converter that will take all posts ending in .upcase and
process them using the UpcaseConverter:

{% highlight ruby %}
module Jekyll
  class UpcaseConverter < Converter
    safe true
    priority :low

    def matches(ext)
      ext =~ /upcase/i
    end

    def output_ext(ext)
      ".html"
    end

    def convert(content)
      content.upcase
    end
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Converters should implement at a minimum 3 methods:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>matches</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Called to determine whether the specific converter will
run on the page.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>output_ext</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>The extension of the outputted file, usually this will be <code>.html</code></p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>convert</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Logic to do the content conversion</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

In our example, UpcaseConverter-matches checks if our filename extension is `.upcase`, and will render using the converter if it is. It will call UpcaseConverter-convert to process the content - in our simple converter we’re simply capitalizing the entire content string. Finally, when it saves the page, it will do so with the `.html` extension.

## Tags

If you’d like to include custom liquid tags in your site, you can do so
by hooking into the tagging system. Built-in examples added by Jekyll
include the `{{"{% highlight "}}%}` and `{{"{% include "}}%}` tags. Below is an example custom liquid tag that will output the time the page was rendered:

{% highlight ruby %}
module Jekyll
  class RenderTimeTag < Liquid::Tag

    def initialize(tag_name, text, tokens)
      super
      @text = text
    end

    def render(context)
      "#{@text} #{Time.now}"
    end
  end
end

Liquid::Template.register_tag('render_time', Jekyll::RenderTimeTag)
{% endhighlight %}

At a minimum, liquid tags must implement:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Method</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>render</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>Outputs the content of the tag.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You must also register the custom tag with the Liquid template engine as follows:

{% highlight ruby %}
Liquid::Template.register_tag('render_time', Jekyll::RenderTimeTag)
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above, we can place the following tag anywhere in one of our pages:

{% highlight ruby %}
<p>{{"{% render_time page rendered at: "}}%}</p>
{% endhighlight %}

And we would get something like this on the page:

{% highlight html %}
<p>page rendered at: Tue June 22 23:38:47 –0500 2010</p>
{% endhighlight %}

### Liquid filters

You can add your own filters to the Liquid template system much like you can add tags above. Filters are simply modules that export their methods to liquid. All methods will have to take at least one parameter which represents the input of the filter. The return value will be the output of the filter.

{% highlight ruby %}
module Jekyll
  module AssetFilter
    def asset_url(input)
      "http://www.example.com/#{input}?#{Time.now.to_i}"
    end
  end
end

Liquid::Template.register_filter(Jekyll::AssetFilter)
{% endhighlight %}

<div class="note">
  <h5>ProTip™: Access the site object using Liquid</h5>
  <p>Jekyll lets you access the <code>site</code> object through the <code>context.registers</code> feature of liquid. For example, you can access the global configuration file <code>_config.yml</code> using <code>context.registers.config</code>.</p>
</div>

### Flags

There are two flags to be aware of when writing a plugin:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Flag</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>safe</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>A boolean flag that allows a plugin to be safely included in
Jekyll core for exclusion from use with GitHub Pages. In general, set
this to <code>true</code>.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <p><code>priortiy</code></p>
      </td>
      <td>
        <p>This flag determines what order the plugin is loaded in. Valid
values are: <code>:lowest</code>, <code>:low</code>, <code>:normal</code>, <code>:high</code>, and <code>:highest</code>.</p>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

To use one of the example plugins above as an illustration, here is how you’d specify these two flags:

{% highlight ruby %}
module Jekyll
  class UpcaseConverter < Converter
    safe true
    priority :low
    ...
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
