Jekyll 2.2.0 contains a few key updates:

1. A warning will now fire if you specify a layout in any of your pages or
    posts that doesn't exist.
2. Certain Pygments options are now whitelisted in safe mode
3. Categories in a post's path are now respected (i.e. folders in `_posts`
   will now work properly).

As always, a full list of the updates are on the
[history page](/docs/history/#v2-2-0). Happy Jekylling!
