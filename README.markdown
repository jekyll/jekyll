Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which you can use to host your project's page or blog right here from GitHub.
