<p>Jekyll 4.2.2 has been released. Unlike prior releases, this is a simple maintenance release and may be skipped.</p>

<p>For those who are still curious about the current release, here is some technical context: The previous <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll-4.2.1</code> package was built and
published using a Windows system. A side-effect of that action was that every file bundled into the gem ended up with Windows-style CRLF
line-endings instead of Unix-style LF line-endings.</p>

<p>For our end-users, this difference holds no significance. However, a third-party entity vendoring the release faced a roadblock. The executable
program <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll</code> apparently misplaced the executable bit because of the change in line-endings.</p>

<p>To that end, the Jekyll team decided to use the GitHub Actions service to build and publish releases. In-house plugins have already published
releases via this route serving as trials. Henceforth, and unless explicitly reported, all Jekyll releases will be built on GitHub Actions’
Ubuntu platform and published to Rubygems by @jekyllbot irrespective of the maintainer overseeing the release.</p>

<p>That is all for now.
Happy Jekyllin’!!</p>

<p><em>P.S.: Jekyll 4.3.0 will be bringing you some new features very soon.. Also, our sass-converter plugin has been <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-sass-converter/tree/v2.2.0#sass-embedded">enhanced</a> to support
modern improvements to Sass.</em></p>]]></content><author><name>ashmaroli</name></author><category term="release" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Jekyllers!]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://jekyllrb.com/img/jekyll-og.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://jekyllrb.com/img/jekyll-og.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Jekyll 4.2.1 Released</title><link href="https://jekyllrb.com/news/2021/09/27/jekyll-4-2-1-released/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Jekyll 4.2.1 Released" /><published>2021-09-27T02:15:46-07:00</published><updated>2021-09-27T02:15:46-07:00</updated><id>https://jekyllrb.com/news/2021/09/27/jekyll-4-2-1-released</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://jekyllrb.com/news/2021/09/27/jekyll-4-2-1-released/"><![CDATA[<p>Hello Jekyllers!</p>

<p>The Jekyll team is happy to announce the release of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v4.2.1</code> which fixes a couple of
regressions introduced in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v4.2.0</code> and another bug inherited from Jekyll 3.</p>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v4.2.0</code>, we decided to stop overriding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{{ site.url }}</code> with
the <em>localhost</em> address when running the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> with the default
<em>development</em> mode. While the intent behind the change was to avoid forcing users to
generate a <em>production build</em> separately by invoking <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code>, it however had an
unforeseen consequence — absolute URLs for assets now pointed to
resources that were at times not yet been deployed to the configured <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.url</code>. That
broke the users’ local development workflow.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v4.2.0</code> also added a series of optimizations surrounding the generation of Liquid
representation for a site’s standalone pages and layouts. However, that prevented
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{{ page.content }}</code> and other mutable attributes from reflecting
the latest state of the requested attribute, thereby breaking the render of all resources
that were dependent on such mutable attributes.</p>

<p>The last fix included in this release addresses the issue where incremental regeneration
ignored changes to documents in collections when the site is configured to use a custom
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">collections_dir</code> for all collections.</p>

<p>Special thanks to @benik for helping us understand the regression caused by the decision
to stop overriding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.url</code> and proposing to revert the change. Another special thanks
to @pdmosses for helping us discover the regression surrounding Liquid representation of
pages by providing with a test repository.</p>

by his GitHub username @DirtyF.</p>

<p>Ruby not being his forte, he chose to avoid code-level changes and instead focus on what he did best — <em>engage with
the community</em>.</p>

<p>He helped resolve complaints reported on the GitHub issue tracker, ensured that Jekyll documentation remained simple for
novice users yet detailed enough for advanced users seeking additional information.</p>

<p>He also served as the administrator for Jekyll’s public <a href="https://talk.jekyllrb.com/">discourse forum</a> where he not only
addressed queries from users and provided tips to improve Jekyll workflow, he also shared feedback on Jekyll sites
created by the community, and used the forum as a platform to gather feedback on unreleased iterations of Jekyll and
in-house plugins.</p>

<p>Abreast with latest developments in the Web-verse, Frank was always quick to introduce technologies that vastly improved
maintenance in the Jekyll organization. He was instrumental in setting up deploy previews for patches to Jekyll’s
documentation site and later wiring GitHub Actions to handle continuous integrations for Jekyll and in-house projects.</p>

<p>In spite of spiritually moving away from Jekyll during the later part of his career, choosing to concentrate efforts on
furthering JAMstack projects, he greatly remained active on Jekyll’s development channel on Slack relaying key feedback
from the community or discuss concerns regarding the future of Jekyll at length.</p>

<p>Having untimely left Jekyll and our community with an unfillable void, he will be missed immensely. :broken_heart:</p>

Jekyll v4.2.0 is out!</p>

<p>This release gives you a new hook named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:post_convert</code> that allows modifying rendered HTML contents before they are
placed into the designated layout(s).</p>

<p>Detecting files that get written into the same destination path has been a part of the diagnostics from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll doctor</code>
for quite some time now. However, v4.2 has integrated that feature into the build process itself.</p>

<p>On the topic of log output, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--verbose</code> output got a bit more verbose. Instead of just showing <em>documents</em> that are
being read, the output will now also show <em>pages</em> and <em>layouts</em> that are being read into the site.</p>

<p>Additionally, we have stopped overriding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.url</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:4000</code> in absolute URLs while developing
via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>.</p>

<p>As always, you can go through <a href="/docs/history/#v4-2-0">the full list of changes</a> if you are interested in the various
memory-allocation optimizations made to Jekyll.</p>

<p>If you choose to upgrade, please note that the GitHub-Flavored Markdown
parser and other features of kramdown v1 are now distributed via
separate gems. If you would like to continue using these features, you will
need to add the gems to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code>. They are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GFM parser – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown-parser-gfm</code></li>
  <li>coderay syntax highlighter – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown-syntax-coderay</code></li>
  <li>mathjaxnode math engine – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown-math-mathjaxnode</code></li>
  <li>sskatex math engine – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown-math-sskatex</code></li>
  <li>katex math engine – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown-math-katex</code></li>
  <li>ritex math engine – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown-math-ritex</code></li>
  <li>itex2mml math engine – <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kramdown-math-itex2mml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Jekyll will require the given gem when the configuration requires it, and
will show a helpful message when a dependency is missing.</p>

<p>You can check out the patches and see all the details in <a href="/docs/history/#v3-9-0">the release notes</a></p>

However these seemingly benign changes had unexpected adverse side-effects which did not figure in our tests.</p>

<p>The Core team decided that the best way forward is to revert introduction of the Liquid drop for Pages but push back
generating excerpts for pages behind a flag until <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v5.0</code>.</p>

<p>Page-excerpts are henceforth an opt-in experimental feature which can be enabled by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page_excerpts: true</code> in
your configuration file. Due to its experimental nature, we have narrowed the scope for page-excerpts to limit their
negative effect on builds. Excerpts will not be generated for pages that <em>do not</em> output into an HTML file even if
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page_excerpts: true</code> has been set in the configuration file.</p>

<p>Another known issue with page-excerpts is that an infinite loop is created in certain use-cases such as any construct
that involves iterating through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">site.pages</code> directly within a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll::Page</code> instance. A couple of examples would be
having a variant of either of the following code blocks inside a page source, say <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.markdown</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">about.markdown</code>:</p>

<div class="language-liquid highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">entry</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">in</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">site.pages</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
  <span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">entry</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>
<span class="p">{%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nt">endfor</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">%}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-liquid highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">site</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nv">pages</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">sort</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'title'</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Therefore, we advise caution when opting to use the page-excerpt feature.</p>]]></content><author><name>ashmaroli</name></author><category term="release" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jekyll 4.1.0 brought two notable changes: Page-excerpts and Liquid Drop for Page objects.

<p>It’s time for yet another release that includes enhancements, optimizations and bug-fixes. Highlights of this release
are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jekyll now supports rendering excerpts for <em>pages</em> in addition to documents and posts.</li>
  <li>The <a href="/docs/liquid/filters/#where-expression"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where_exp</code></a> filter got enhanced.  Earlier, one could just use either <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">and</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">or</code> once
per expression. Now, one may use those binary operators multiple times in the filter’s expression.</li>
  <li>Jekyll has a new set of filters based on <em>its flavor</em> of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">where_exp</code> filters. Named
<a href="/docs/liquid/filters/#find"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find</code></a> and <a href="/docs/liquid/filters/#find-expression"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">find_exp</code></a> filters respectively, they work similar to their ancestors
except that they return <strong>the first object</strong> that satisfies the given conditions.</li>
  <li>Jekyll’s <a href="/docs/liquid/filters/#number-of-words"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">number_of_words</code></a> filter can now take an optional argument to better count words
of text containing Chinese, Japanese or Korean characters.</li>
  <li>One may now use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:slugified_categories</code> in their permalink configurations to generate a more apt URL (categories are
downcased and non-alphanumeric characters replaced by dashes) for their for posts and documents.</li>
  <li>The logic for <em>slugifying</em> a given string has been enhanced to support more Unicode characters.</li>
  <li>If you face issues from Jekyll importing a config file bundled within a theme, you can now disable the import entirely
by setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ignore_theme_config: true</code> in your site’s configuration file.</li>
  <li>If you face issues from Jekyll’s disk-caching feature, you can now disable the mechanism without opting to build in
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">safe</code> mode, by either setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">disable_disk_cache: true</code> in your configuration file or by passing the CLI switch
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--disable-disk-cache</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code> commands.</li>
  <li>When you build a site with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--profile</code> switch, Jekyll will now additionally output a small table showing the amount
of time taken during various stages of the <em>build process</em>.</li>
  <li>Jekyll’s development server now supports certificates based on Elliptic-curve cryptography.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the interest of plugin authors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Excerpts won’t be generated for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jekyll::Page</code> subclasses automatically unless such instances have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">excerpt</code> key in
their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code> hash.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the interest of gem-based theme authors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>From <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v4.1.0</code> onwards, a newly generated theme workspace (via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll new-theme ...</code>) will have the gemspec configured
to bundle a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> at the root of the workspace. If you don’t wish to include the configuration file in the
released gem, please remove <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|_config\.yml</code> from the regular expression in the gemspec.</li>
</ul>
