    And the _site directory should exist
    And I should see "next post: Some like it hot" in "_site/2009/03/27/star-wars.html"
    And I should see "Previous post: Some like it hot" in "_site/2009/05/27/terminator.html"

  Scenario: Deprecate calling data keys directly via Ruby
    Given I have a _posts directory
    And I have a _plugins directory
    And I have the following post:
      | title   | date       | content                 |
      | My post | 2016-01-21 | Luke, I am your father. |
    And I have a "_plugins/foo.rb" file with content:
      """
      Jekyll::Hooks.register :documents, :pre_render do |doc|
        doc.title
      end
      """
    And I have a "_plugins/bar.rb" file with content:
      """
      module FooBar
        def self.dummy?(doc)
          doc.title == "Dummy Document"
        end
      end

      Jekyll::Hooks.register :documents, :post_render do |doc|
        FooBar.dummy?(doc)
      end
      """
    When I run jekyll build
    Then I should get a zero exit status
    And the _site directory should exist
    And I should see "Deprecation: Document#title" in the build output
    And I should see "_plugins/foo.rb:2" in the build output
    And I should see "_plugins/bar.rb:3" in the build output
    But I should not see "lib/jekyll/document.rb" in the build output
